# Online-Food-order-website

The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for online food ordering system. 
This system can be implemented to any shop in the locality or to multinational branded shops having retail outlet chains. The system recommends a facility to accept the orders 24*7

If shops are providing an online portal where their customers can  enjoy easy shopping from anywhere, the shops wonâ€™t be losing any more customers to the trending online shops such as flipcart or ebay. Since the application is available in the Smartphone it is easily accessible and always available.
